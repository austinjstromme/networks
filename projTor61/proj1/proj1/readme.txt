messages.js contains helper methods for creating messages to be used in the registration protocall. client.js is an event-loop based client to be used in the registration protocall.

to run the program enter node client.js xxxxx where xxxxx is the port you wish to run the client on. If you do not enter a portnumber then the program won't work correctly, specifically the registration service won't be able to send probes to the client.
